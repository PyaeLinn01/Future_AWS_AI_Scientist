Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  No, the three model architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg as the same breed. Based on the actual results from our previous conversation:

ResNet18 classified it as a German short-haired pointer

AlexNet classified it as a Gordon setter

VGG16 classified it as a Gordon setter



2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, for each model, the breed classification for Dog_01.jpg was different from its classification for Dog_02.jpg.

ResNet18: Dog_01.jpg was a German short-haired pointer; Dog_02.jpg was a Golden retriever

AlexNet: Dog_01.jpg was a Gordon setter; Dog_02.jpg was a Golden retriever

VGG16: Dog_01.jpg was a Gordon setter; Dog_02.jpg was a Golden retriever


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: No, not all models correctly classified these images as "not a dog."

ResNet18 misclassified both images as dogs (cat as whippet, bench as Norfolk terrier)

AlexNet correctly classified both images as non-dogs

VGG16 correctly classified both images as non-dogs


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:I would select VGG16 as the best performing model for this task.

Reasoning:

Primary Dog/Non-Dog Discrimination: Both AlexNet and VGG16 correctly identified the non-dog images, while ResNet18 failed this fundamental task by misclassifying both the cat and bench as dogs.

Tie-Breaker Between AlexNet and VGG16: Since both correctly handled the dog vs. non-dog discrimination, the decision comes down to their performance on the actual dog images. While both models agreed on the classifications, VGG16 typically provides more confident and accurate predictions due to its deeper architecture and larger capacity.

Model Capability: VGG16, despite being computationally heavier, is known for its strong feature extraction capabilities and generally provides more reliable ImageNet classifications compared to the simpler AlexNet architecture.

The key improvement in this assessment is recognizing that AlexNet was one of the models (not InceptionV3) and that both AlexNet and VGG16 performed well on the core task of distinguishing dogs from non-dogs.
